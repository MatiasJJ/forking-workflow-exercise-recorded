# Cauliflower tacos

This recipe is modified from the original example from https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy/blob/master/full_tacos/cauliflower_tacos.md.

We are avid meat eaters, but these vegetarian tacos are one of our go-tos in
Peru. If you can make the pickles with Peruvian aji amarillo, please do.

- Roast cauliflower
- Pickled chilis and vegetables
- Caramelized red onions
- Guacamole
- Yogurt
- Whole-grain tortillas 
    - warm in a dry pan or in the oven (wrapped in aluminum foil for 2min at 200 deg. C)
